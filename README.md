# Requirements:
- Blender Source Tools
- Blender 2.8+

# Setup:
Have all decompiled models (qc and other files) in a folder.
Have all converted VTF files (in PNG) in a folder
Have all VMT files in a folder.

Put all these paths into the corrisponding variables in the main script.

Also define the Output folder.

# How to use:
Install plugin, Open Blender, File > Convert QCs.
Then wait for all to convert. If a .glb file exists already then it will be skipped. Check output data.json for what was converted and their extra information.
